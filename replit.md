- **Passport.js** with local strategy for authentication
- **Express Session** with PostgreSQL session store for session management
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations
- **Neon Database** for PostgreSQL hosting
- **bcrypt** for password hashing

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Database schema includes companies, departments, users, jobs, candidates, and pipeline tracking

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication using Passport.js
- Role-based access control (admin, recruiter, manager, candidate)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Protected routes on both frontend and backend

### Database Schema
- **Companies (empresas)**: Organization management
- **Departments (departamentos)**: Department structure within companies
- **Users (usuarios)**: System users with role-based permissions
- **Jobs (vagas)**: Job postings with detailed requirements
- **Candidates (candidatos)**: Candidate profiles and information

### Backend Architecture
- RESTful API design with Express.js
- Modular route organization

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through the frontend, which sends credentials to the backend API
2. **Session Management**: Backend creates secure sessions stored in PostgreSQL
3. **API Requests**: Frontend makes authenticated requests using TanStack Query
4. **Database Operations**: Backend uses Drizzle ORM to interact with PostgreSQL
5. **Real-time Updates**: Query invalidation ensures UI stays synchronized with database changes

- PostgreSQL database connection via environment variables
- Session storage in PostgreSQL for development consistency

### Production Build
- Frontend built with Vite to static assets
- Backend bundled with ESBuild for Node.js deployment
- Static file serving through Express
- PostgreSQL connection pooling for production scalability

### Environment Configuration
